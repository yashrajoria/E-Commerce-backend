## 📋 Overview

This repository contains the microservices-based backend for ShopSwift, an enterprise-grade e-commerce platform. The system is designed for high availability, scalability, and maintainability, leveraging a distributed architecture with independent services.

The backend is built entirely in **Go**, providing superior performance, efficient concurrency handling, and a robust standard library for building distributed systems.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

The backend follows a microservices architectural pattern, consisting of:

### **API Gateway**
The entry point for all client requests, responsible for:
- Request routing to appropriate services
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and request validation
- Centralized logging and monitoring

### **Core Services**
- **Auth Service:** Manages user authentication, registration, and session tokens
- **User Service:** Handles user profile management and account settings
- **Product Service:** Manages product catalog, categories, and inventory data
- **Order Service:** Handles order placement, tracking, and history
- **Inventory Service:** Real-time stock management and updates
- **Common:** Shared libraries, utilities, and middleware used across all services

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Distributed System:** Independent services that can be scaled and deployed separately
- **API Gateway Routing:** Centralized entry point with optimized request handling
- **Polyglot Persistence Support:** Architecture designed for PostgreSQL and MongoDB
- **High Performance:** Leverages Go's efficient runtime and concurrency primitives
- **Security:** Integrated authentication and authorization flows across services
- **Scalability:** Container-ready architecture for orchestrated deployments
- **Robust Error Handling:** Comprehensive error management and logging
- **Middleware Integration:** Centralized security and logging middleware

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.20 or higher
- PostgreSQL & MongoDB
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yashrajoria/E-Commerce-backend.git
cd E-Commerce-backend
```

2. **Navigate to a specific service**
```bash
cd backend/services/auth-service
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
go mod download
```

### Running Locally

Each service can be run independently:

```bash
go run main.go
```

To run the entire system, it's recommended to start the services in order (Auth, Products, etc.) and then start the API Gateway.

---

## 🔐 Security

The backend implements several security best practices:
- Centralized authentication via Auth Service
- Password hashing with validation
- Secure middleware for protected routes
- Request validation and sanitization
- Environment variable management for sensitive data

---

## 🚧 Future Roadmap

- [ ] Implementation of gRPC for inter-service communication
- [ ] Centralized configuration management
- [ ] Service discovery with Consul or Etcd
- [ ] Message queue integration (RabbitMQ/Kafka) for async tasks
- [ ] Comprehensive unit and integration test suite
- [ ] Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and monitoring
- [ ] ELK stack for centralized logging
- [ ] Distributed tracing with Jaeger

## 📝 Development Notes

### Technical Decisions
- **Go Selection:** Chosen for its performance, type safety, and first-class support for networking and concurrency.
- **Microservices vs Monolith:** Adopted to allow independent scaling and development of different domains.
- **RESTful Design:** Provides a standardized and well-documented interface for frontend applications.

### Performance
- Minimal runtime overhead
- Efficient memory management
- Fast startup times for services
- High throughput handling
