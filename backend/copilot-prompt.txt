You are an expert DevOps engineer. I have a Go-based microservices e-commerce backend project with the following structure:

backend/
  api-gateway/
  services/
    auth-service/
    bff-service/
    cart-service/
    inventory-service/
    order-service/
    payment-service/
    product-service/
    user-service/

I have created a new branch called `aws-deployment`. I want to prepare this branch to support CI/CD deployment to AWS (via KodeKloud playground) while continuing local development on LocalStack. 

Please make the following changes **without touching any business logic or Go code**:

1. Create two environment files:
   - `.env.local` → for LocalStack dev
     - DB_HOST=localstack
     - SQS_ENDPOINT=http://localstack:4566
     - Add placeholders for any other service URLs
   - `.env.aws` → for AWS deployment
     - DB_HOST=aws-rds-endpoint
     - SQS_ENDPOINT=https://sqs.aws-region.amazonaws.com
     - Add placeholders for other service URLs

2. Create a folder `backend/infrastructure/aws/` for deployment scripts or Terraform configs.

3. Create CI/CD GitHub Actions files:
   - `.github/workflows/ci-main.yml` → build + test all services on `main` branch (local dev)
   - `.github/workflows/ci-aws.yml` → build + test all services, build Docker images, push to Docker Hub, and optionally deploy to EC2 when `aws-deployment` branch is pushed

4. Docker images:
   - Each service should have a Docker image tagged with `latest` and `commit SHA`
   - Use environment variable placeholders for credentials

5. GitHub Secrets placeholders:
   - DOCKERHUB_USERNAME
   - DOCKERHUB_TOKEN
   - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   - EC2_HOST
   - EC2_USER
   - EC2_SSH_KEY

6. Include instructions in comments for:
   - Where to put deploy scripts
   - How to run migrations on AWS
   - How to test health endpoints after deploy

7. Do not modify the existing Go code, routes, or service logic. Do not add any new dependencies to services. Only create config, infra, and CI/CD pipeline scaffolding.

Generate complete files, ready to commit to the `aws-deployment` branch.
