    "OpenAPI specification for the API Gateway, BFF (Backend-for-Frontend), and all backend microservices of the\
    \ ecommerce platform.\n## Architecture Overview\nThe system is composed of the following layers:\n- **API Gateway** (`:8080`)\
    \ — Single ingress point. Validates JWT access\n  tokens from the `access_token` cookie, enforces role-based access control,\n\
    \  and proxies requests to the appropriate downstream service.\n\n- **BFF Service** (`:8088`) — Aggregates data from multiple\
    \ services into\n  single, page-optimised responses for the web frontend. All BFF endpoints\n  also flow through the Gateway.\n\
    \n- **Auth Service** (`:8081`) — Issues and validates JWT access tokens\n  (short-lived) and refresh tokens (long-lived).\
    \ Both tokens are delivered\n  as HttpOnly cookies.\n\n- **User Service** (`:8085`) — Manages user profiles and credential\
    \ changes.\n- **Product Service** (`:8082`) — Product catalogue, category tree, bulk\n  import/export, and presigned S3\
    \ upload URLs.\n\n- **Cart Service** (`:8086`) — Per-user shopping cart and checkout\n  initiation.\n\n- **Order Service**\
    \ (`:8083`) — Order lifecycle management.\n- **Payment Service** (`:8087`) — Stripe payment session creation,\n  verification,\
    \ and webhook ingestion.\n\n- **Inventory Service** — Stock management, reservation, release, and\n  confirmation as part\
    \ of the order saga.\n\n## Authentication\nAll protected endpoints require a valid JWT `access_token` cookie issued by\
    \ the Auth Service. The gateway rejects missing or expired tokens with `401 Unauthorized`. Refresh the token via `POST\
    \ /auth/refresh` before it expires.\n## Role-Based Access Control\n| Role    | Description                           \
    \               | |---------|------------------------------------------------------| | `user`  | Standard registered customer\
    \                         | | `admin` | Platform administrator — full catalogue & order mgmt |\nEndpoints restricted to\
    \ `admin` are marked with the \U0001F510 **Admin Only** tag. Calling them with a `user` token returns `403 Forbidden`.\n\
    ## Idempotency\nState-mutating operations that must be safe to retry accept an optional `Idempotency-Key` header. Supplying\
    \ the same key within the deduplication window returns the cached original response without re-executing the operation.\n\
    ## Error Responses\nAll errors follow the `ErrorResponse` schema: `{ \"error\": \"...\", \"details\": \"...\" }`.\n"
